 //A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and runs when it is called.
// Instead of writing the same code again and again, we write it once inside a function and use it whenever needed.
 //Why we use functions:
        //To save time and avoid repeating code
        //To make programs easy to read and understand
        //To divide a big problem into smaller parts
        //Example (easy words):
        //If you want to add two numbers many times, you can create a function to do the addition and call it
        // whenever required.
        //In short, a function helps us organize our program better 👍
  //Function always starts with keyword void then fun name and open and close parenthesis
  //void m1() {}
 //Like variables fun can also be Static and non-static hence a func cannot be written inside another func.
//It can accept arguments void m1(int a){}
//Static func can be referred with the help of class name. Non-static methods are called with object.
//void means it will not return any value.void m1() {} return; but if insted void we write int m1() {} then
 // it must return an int return 10;
    }
